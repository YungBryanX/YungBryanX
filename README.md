Finishing up my undergrad degree, trying to develop an Open Source Software contribution habit before I start working.

I have experience making web apps with Python Flask and HTML/CSS/JS, but I am looking to get back into node.js stuff. Will be working on a few "good-first-commit" tagged issues for a bit and see where it takes me.
